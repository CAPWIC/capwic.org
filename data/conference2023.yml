  tracks:
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 24” x 32” poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Technical Workshops
      description: >
        Workshops present a valuable and current technical skill in a hands-on training session. Proposals must include abstract, the intended audience and power/AV equipment/space needs.
    - name: Panels
      description: >
        Panels present multiple perspectives on a topic. Proposals should include abstract, a list of presenters including their affiliation and perspective, along with a proposed length of 25 or 50 minutes.
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 30 minutes.
    - name: Technical Talks
      description: >
        25 minute technical talk with 5 minutes for questions on a relevant and current technical topic. Priority given to younger faculty and industry partners.

  - name: Lance Collins
    img: collins.jpg
    bio: |
      <p>Lance R. Collins in 2020 was named the inaugural vice president and executive director of the
      Virginia Tech Innovation Campus. Prior to that he was dean of engineering at Cornell. In 2011,
      he was part of the team that successfully bid to partner with New York City to build Cornell
      Tech. As dean, Collins accelerated the college’s diversity efforts, overseeing the increase in
      underrepresented minority students from 8 to 19 percent, and undergraduate women from 33
      to 50 percent. Collins’ research uses simulation to study turbulent processes. In 2021 he was
      elected to the National Academy of Engineering.</p>
      <h5>Inspiration from “hidden figure”, Dr. Gladys B. West, who made seminal contributions to the global positioning system (GPS)</h5>
      <p>The Earth is not a perfect sphere.  Indeed, it’s shape is far from round, and that complexity must be accounted for to achieve accurate GPS.  My presentation chronicles the contributions made by Dr. Gladys B. West, an African American mathematician.  Born in rural Dinwiddie County, Virginia in 1930, Dr. West studied mathematics at Virginia State University before joining the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where she led the effort to accurately map the surface of the Earth, leading to centimeter precision in modern GPS systems.  Her remarkable achievements against all odds are an inspiration to us all; however, this talk is not just a tale of individual exceptionalism, but rather a reminder of the lost opportunity incurred by society overlooking the talents that women and minorities can bring to the technological workforce.  Indeed, this motivates our goal to make the Virginia Tech Innovation Campus the most diverse graduate tech program in the country.</p>

      <h5>Agile Mindset through Games</h5>
      <p>Agile is a mindset that takes practice! This session is an extremely interactive experience that revolves around the Agile core values and principles that we will explore through challenges, games, and discussion.  These values and principles underlay the meetings, ceremonies, and ways of working of the major Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban. These frameworks are used in startups to major corporations with many customized flavors that are adapted through returning to the mindset as the guiding principle.   </p>

              <h5>Inspiration from “hidden figure”, Dr. Gladys B. West, who made seminal contributions to the global positioning system (GPS)</h5>
              <h7>Lance Collins<h7>
              <p><i>Virginia Tech</i></p>
              <p>The Earth is not a perfect sphere.  Indeed, it’s shape is far from round, and that complexity must be accounted for to achieve accurate GPS.  My presentation chronicles the contributions made by Dr. Gladys B. West, an African American mathematician.  Born in rural Dinwiddie County, Virginia in 1930, Dr. West studied mathematics at Virginia State University before joining the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia, where she led the effort to accurately map the surface of the Earth, leading to centimeter precision in modern GPS systems.  Her remarkable achievements against all odds are an inspiration to us all; however, this talk is not just a tale of individual exceptionalism, but rather a reminder of the lost opportunity incurred by society overlooking the talents that women and minorities can bring to the technological workforce.  Indeed, this motivates our goal to make the Virginia Tech Innovation Campus the most diverse graduate tech program in the country.</p>

  tracks:
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 24” x 32” poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Technical Workshops
      description: >
        Workshops present a valuable and current technical skill in a hands-on training session. Proposals must include abstract, the intended audience and power/AV equipment/space needs.
    - name: Panels
      description: >
        Panels present multiple perspectives on a topic. Proposals should include abstract, a list of presenters including their affiliation and perspective, along with a proposed length of 25 or 50 minutes.
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 30 minutes.
    - name: Technical Talks
      description: >
        25 minute technical talk with 5 minutes for questions on a relevant and current technical topic. Priority given to younger faculty and industry partners.

#      <p>Cheryl Denise Seals is the Charles W. Barkley Endowed Professor of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University. She has taught and developed eight courses during her tenure (i.e. HCI, UI, AI, etc.) and directed the development of dozens of software systems through iterative development and participatory design related to her background in Human-Computer Interaction and Usability Evaluation. Dr. Seals current research develops Advanced Learning Technologies for multiple domains (i.e. Linguistics, Medical Training, Building Science, Teaching and Learning) and some of these applications include the use of training supported with Virtual Reality applications. Seals is practiced in methods needed to evaluate and illicit participatory feedback from novice and professional audiences.</p> 
#      <p>Seals has also performed research funded by NSF in Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC). One project was the STARS alliance connecting 50 partner institutions actively in BPC. The STARS alliance creates opportunities for students to work in the areas of research, outreach or service to increase the number of under-represented students in the computing pipeline (and created a national conference iEEE RESPECT as a venue to publish BPC research.</p> 
#      <p>Dr. Seals is a Co-Principal Investigator of IAAMCS “I-am-CS” Alliance, which works also to increase the computing pipeline and further develop an ecosystem that creates opportunities for African American students to learn more about research and academic careers, through summer and academic year research experience and research training.

#  - name: NASA Modern Figures Panel 
#    img: nasa-panel.jpg
#    bio: |
#        <p>Hidden Figures is a movie and book based on actual events. While the movie dramatizes some aspects, it is true to the struggles of the women at the center of the story. The victories for racial and gender rights were not achieved easily or quickly, and our work is not done. Today, NASA strives to make sure their legacy of inclusion and excellence lives on.</p>
#        <p>As seen in the movie Hidden Figures, NASA has a long-standing cultural commitment to excellence that is largely driven by data, including data about our people. And our data shows progress is driven by questioning our assumptions and cultural prejudices – by embracing and nurturing all the talent we have available, regardless of gender, race or other protected status, to build a workforce as diverse as its mission. This is how we, as a nation, will take the next giant leap in exploration.</p>
#        <p>As a world leader in science, aeronautics, space exploration and technology, NASA has a diverse mission that demands talent from every corner of America, and every walk of life. With the human computers portrayed in Hidden Figures, NASA began leading the way in building a workforce as diverse as its mission – a workforce that will use the International Space Station to help put humans on Mars; make exciting discoveries about our universe; carry out research that will create greener, safer, quieter and faster air travel; monitor the health of our home planet; and develop cutting-edge technologies to explore our solar system and improve life on Earth.</p>
#        <p>In the 1960's, NASA was on an ambitious journey to the moon, and the human computers portrayed in Hidden Figures helped get us there. Today, NASA is on an even more ambitious journey toward sustainable Human lunar exploration and then on to human exploration at Mars.  NASA calls this the "Artemis Generation Moon to Mars".

#        <p><i>Hidden Figures</i> is a movie and book based on actual events. While the movie dramatizes some aspects, it is true to the struggles of the women at the center of the story. The victories for racial and gender rights were not achieved easily or quickly, and our work is not done. Today, NASA strives to make sure their legacy of inclusion and excellence lives on.</p>
#        <p>As seen in the movie <i>Hidden Figures</i>, NASA has a long-standing cultural commitment to excellence that is largely driven by data, including data about our people. And our data shows progress is driven by questioning our assumptions and cultural prejudices – by embracing and nurturing all the talent we have available, regardless of gender, race or other protected status, to build a workforce as diverse as its mission. This is how we, as a nation, will take the next giant leap in exploration.</p>
#        <p>As a world leader in science, aeronautics, space exploration and technology, NASA has a diverse mission that demands talent from every corner of America, and every walk of life. With the human computers portrayed in <i>Hidden Figures</i>, NASA began leading the way in building a workforce as diverse as its mission – a workforce that will use the International Space Station to help put humans on Mars; make exciting discoveries about our universe; carry out research that will create greener, safer, quieter and faster air travel; monitor the health of our home planet; and develop cutting-edge technologies to explore our solar system and improve life on Earth.</p>

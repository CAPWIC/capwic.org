  - name: NASA Modern Figures Panel
    img: capwic 2020 panel.png
    bio: |
      <p>Hidden Figures is a movie based on actual events. While the movie dramatizes some aspects, it is true to the struggles of the women at the center of the story. The victories for racial and gender rights were not achieved easily or quickly, and our work is not done. Today, NASA strives to make sure their legacy of inclusion and excellence lives on.</p>
      <p>As seen in the movie Hidden Figures, NASA has a long-standing cultural commitment to excellence that is largely driven by data, including data about our people. And our data shows progress is driven by questioning our assumptions and cultural prejudices ‚Äì by embracing and nurturing all the talent we have available, regardless of gender, race or other protected status, to build a workforce as diverse as its mission. This is how we, as a nation, will take the next giant leap in exploration.</p>
      <p>As a world leader in science, aeronautics, space exploration and technology, NASA has a diverse mission that demands talent from every corner of America, and every walk of life. With the human computers portrayed in Hidden Figures, NASA began leading the way in building a workforce as diverse as its mission ‚Äì a workforce that will use the International Space Station to help put humans on Mars; make exciting discoveries about our universe; carry out research that will create greener, safer, quieter and faster air travel; monitor the health of our home planet; and develop cutting-edge technologies to explore our solar system and improve life on Earth.</p>
      <p>In the 1960‚Äôs, NASA was on an ambitious journey to the moon, and the human computers portrayed in Hidden Figures helped get us there. Today, NASA is on an even more ambitious journey to Mars. We are building a vibrant, innovative workforce that reflects a vast diversity of discipline and thought, embracing and nurturing all the talent we have available, regardless of gender, race or other protected status.</p>

  header: CAPWIC 2020 Cancelled üò¢ - Plan for CAPWIC 2021 at University of Mary Washington
  body: | 
    <p>Dear CAPWIC Community,</p><p>Today the conference leadership decided to cancel CAPWIC 2020 at Christopher Newport University. We are disappointed we won‚Äôt see all of you in person or have our exciting panels, keynotes and fun evening events but we are also convinced this is the responsible decision in light of recent events surrounding Coronavirus (COVID-19).</p><p>The most important consideration in our decision is the safety and well-being of our community. The COVID-19 virus is spreading within the United States, cases now exist in Virginia, indications are they will only grow, and if they do so the conference is likely to be cancelled later. By cancelling now, we can refund your registration costs and we hope that you will be able to cancel your travel plans and get refunds.</p><p>We encourage sponsors to leave their sponsorship funds for next year's conference, but they can also receive refunds if preferred. We'll be in touch separately to ask your preference and discuss the details.</p><p>We will not be able this year to provide a complete online version of the conference, but organizers are looking into what we can provide to support you locally in mentoring one another and encouraging the participation of women in computing. You will be receiving more detailed information from us about that in the days and weeks to come.</p><p>In the meantime planning for CAPWIC 2021 at the University of Mary Washington is already underway. Organizers will also be considering how to plan for a variety of online and in-person participation at that celebration. We hope that you can join us then!</p><p>Thank you for your support and participation in CAPWIC 2020. The conference has really grown with over 300 registrations this year. Seeing all the submissions and interacting with so many of you has been wonderful. Keep up the good work everyone!</p><p>With deep appreciation,<br>Lynn Lambert and Dee A. B. Weikle<br>CAPWIC 2020 Co-Chairs</p>

  tracks:
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 24‚Äù x 32‚Äù poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Technical Workshops
      description: >
        Workshops present a valuable and current technical skill in a hands-on training session. Proposals must include abstract, the intended audience and power/AV equipment/space needs.
    - name: Panels
      description: >
        Panels present multiple perspectives on a topic. Proposals should include abstract, a list of presenters including their affiliation and perspective, along with a proposed length of 25 or 50 minutes.
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 30 minutes.
    - name: Technical Talks
      description: >
        25 minute technical talk with 5 minutes for questions on a relevant and current technical topic. Priority given to younger faculty and industry partners.

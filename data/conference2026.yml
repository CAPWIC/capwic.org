      <h5>Tools in Your Toolbox: What I've Learned as a Professional Female Computer Scientist</h5>
      <p>In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, thriving as a professional in computer science requires not just technical expertise but also adaptability, resilience, and a toolkit of practical strategies for navigating challenges. For women in this field, this journey often involves overcoming unique obstacles while carving out space for innovation, leadership, and growth.</p>
      <p>In this keynote address, I'll share the tools I've cultivated throughout my career as a female computer scientist—tools that have helped me break barriers, foster collaboration, and stay inspired in an ever-changing industry. From technical skills and problem-solving approaches to strategies for handling imposter syndrome and advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion, this talk will offer actionable insights for professionals at every stage of their journey.</p>
      <p>Whether you're just building your toolbox or looking to refine it, my goal is to equip you with empowering lessons learned from real-world experiences: navigating workplace dynamics, balancing competing demands, taking risks, and finding opportunities to mentor and uplift others. Join me as I reflect on what it means to innovate and thrive—not just as a computer scientist, but as a leader, a learner, and an advocate for change in the tech world. Together, let's add some powerful new tools to your toolbox.</p>

  tracks:
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 13-minute presentation with an additional 2 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 36” x 48” poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 50-60 minutes.

    bio: |
      <p>Cynthia Bailey is a Senior Lecturer in the Computer Science Department at Stanford. She has a PhD in high-performance computing from UC San Diego, and her other scholarly specializations include computer science education, tech/AI ethics and social impact, and machine learning/AI algorithms. Her teaching awards include the President's Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel Award for exceptional contributions to undergraduate education at Stanford, a "Top 10 Papers of All Time" award at the 50th anniversary of the ACM SIGCSE technical symposium, and the Stanford Society of Women Engineers' Professor of the Year. Outside of academia, her work experience includes NASA Ames, startups, and expert witness testifying for top intellectual property law firms. She is on leave from Stanford this year to work on AI Policy in the U.S. Senate, as a AAAS AI Policy Fellow.</p>
      <h5>Computing with a Conscience: crafting a career that matches your values</h5>
      <p>Did you fall in love with coding, but have concerns about the negative impacts some technology has had on society and the planet? Are you excited about the potential for technology to improve the world, and want to do your part to realize the best vision of what's possible? I'll share stories of my own journey: from writing simple games, to designing AI algorithms at a startup, to teaching at Stanford, and now advising the US government on AI policy. And I'll share advice on how you can shape your own journey. </p>
  - name: "Beyond Graduation: Finding Your Community as a Professional Woman in Technology"
    img: author-bg.jpg
    bio: |
      <p>As college students, women who are in technology fields often find themselves in the minority. Luckily, most students are able to access supportive student groups such as SWE, WIC, women in data science, and others. But what happens when you graduate and land your first job working as a women in tech? Many women find themselves at companies that are even more gender- imbalanced than their college programs, often in new cities where they have to build new connections from scratch. Many networking groups for women in technology are hard to find or only offer conferences or meetups once or twice a year. It can be challenging to find a supportive community that offers guidance from women's perspective on professional situations such as salary negotiation, getting recognition for your work, and professional development. And as women progress in their careers, additional challenges emerge, including navigating management tracks, maternity leave policies, and juggling family life. Charlottesville Women in Tech (CWIT) is a non-profit that was created to address this need for connection and support among women who work in technology careers. This panel will feature CWIT board members who will share their stories about feeling alone in new jobs, seeking connections, and creating a strong, thriving group of local women who can network and guide each other through career (and life) challenges. The panel will discuss ways to find women in similar situations, how to create networking opportunities, and how to continue fostering connections throughout your entire career.</p>

      <li>Eileen Krepkovich, Senior Research Scientist at Barron Associates and President of Charlottesville Women in Tech</li>
      <li>Elaine Cheng, Chief Information Officer at Shentel and Board Member of Charlottesville Women in Tech</li>

      <h5>What Rocket Science & Banking Have in Common</h5>
      <p>When you think of Rocket Science and Banking you probably don’t think of them as interchangeable careers, but they actually have a lot more in common than you might imagine.

  tracks:
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 24” x 32” poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Technical Workshops
      description: >
        Workshops present a valuable and current technical skill in a hands-on training session. Proposals must include abstract, the intended audience and power/AV equipment/space needs.
    - name: Panels
      description: >
        Panels present multiple perspectives on a topic. Proposals should include abstract, a list of presenters including their affiliation and perspective, along with a proposed length of 25 or 50 minutes.
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 30 minutes.
    - name: Technical Talks
      description: >
        25 minute technical talk with 5 minutes for questions on a relevant and current technical topic. Priority given to younger faculty and industry partners.

    - title: What's a conference?
      description: Research conferences vary widely. They are often categorized in part by the geographic region from which they aim to recruit participants, e.g. regional, national, international. Typically they have a "program" (or "technical program") which is the term used for the part of the conference schedule that involves presentations of the accepted authors' research. Usually the technical program is for some set of academic disciplines or fields of research. Different conferences aim for different amounts of participation from students of different academic stages, researchers, industry members, and community members. Conferences are a great place to meet others in a field from the previous, same, and later stages of their careers and learn about their experiences and their scholarship.

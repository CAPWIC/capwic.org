  tracks:
    - name: Flash Talks
      description: >
        Five-minute presentations with five minutes for questions. Fast-paced talks on preliminary results, work-in progress, or anything fun and creative related to the conference are welcome in this category. All levels of experience are welcome.
    - name: Student Posters
      description: >
        Before the conference, presenters create a 24” x 32” poster of research, a class project, or other type of work-in-progress including efforts to diversify computing and are present at the poster during the session to discuss content. Open to all students. Prizes will be awarded. 
    - name: Student Research Shorts
      description: >
        Research shorts are an opportunity to give a 15-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions, similar to a talk at a research conference. Work should be technical in nature, investigating new ideas in any area of computer science. The intention is to give presenters a friendly environment in which to practice a future technical talk or work out details in an ongoing project to get constructive feedback. Only an abstract is required, so future publication of the work is not limited. 
    - name: Technical Workshops
      description: >
        Workshops present a valuable and current technical skill in a hands-on training session. Proposals must include abstract, the intended audience and power/AV equipment/space needs.
    - name: Panels
      description: >
        Panels present multiple perspectives on a topic. Proposals should include abstract, a list of presenters including their affiliation and perspective, along with a proposed length of 25 or 50 minutes.
    - name: Birds-of-a-Feather
      description: >
        Birds-of-a-feather (BOF) sessions are opportunities for a group of participants with similar concerns to have an informal discussion. BOF sessions will be 30 minutes.
